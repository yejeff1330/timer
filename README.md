# Nerves of Steel
### a MGTC28 Python assignment
This is a game designed around the timer program writtin by Bill Chau

Never of Steel is a party game where players sit in a circle.  When the game begins:

1. The program displays "Players stand"

2. The program sleeps for a random time between 5 to 25 seconds.  While the program is sleeping, players can sit down.  Keep track of the last person to sit down.

3. When sleep is over, the program displays "Time Up.  Last to sit down wins."  Players still standing are eliminated, and the winner is the last person to sit down.
